# Advent of Code

Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code! This repository contains my solutions to the coding challenges from Advent of Code, an annual coding event with daily programming puzzles throughout December.

# About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an online event created by Eric Wastl, consisting of 25 days of coding puzzles, released one per day starting on December 1st and leading up to Christmas.

Each puzzle typically involves problem-solving and algorithmic thinking, and the difficulty often increases as the event progresses. It's a great opportunity to enhance programming skills in various languages and problem-solving techniques.
